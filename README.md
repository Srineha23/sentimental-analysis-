# sentimental-analysis

Sentiment analysis is a type of natural language processing problem that determines the sentiment or emotion of a piece of text. For example, an algorithm could be constructed to classify whether a product’s review was positive, neutral, or negative. Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that involves computers understanding and processing human language. The goal is often to derive meaning from text. Additionally, there are numerous techniques that can be applied to analyse text and extract meaning. For this project, we will focus on building a recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify the sentiment of tweets about airlines using Keras and a pretrained word embedding.

This greatly helps customers in decision making on selection of best fit US Airlines on analyzing the other customer’s opinion in online review sites like Skytrax and other micro-blogging sites like Twitter which provides the Aspect level sentiment analysis.
